If you are on a Mac, you'll need Xcode installed and an iOS device simulator installed via Xcode.

To run the app on the iOS simulator, run `npm run ios` from the root of the repo and it should spin everything up. It may take a little while to build the first time. (make sure that you install the npm dependencies too with `npm i`)

I haven't tried running this on Android as I am coding it on a Mac. The command would be `npm run android`, but I assume that you would need Android Studio and an emulator installed (or connect to your device.)
